# Demonstrates the two ways to run Playwright (prerecorded script or "manual")

# Notes:
# Dont forget to first install the browsers by running: playwright install
# Browsers are heavy. Dont expect to be able to do as much load as usual with Locust. Optimize your tests by blocking requests for unnecessary resources.
# Dont run too many users per worker instance (or you'll get the dreaded "CPU usage over 90%" warning). Instead, scale using more Locust workers. This is made easy by using locust-swarm.
# It is easy to accidentally make Playwright tests stall for a long time, for example if your page does finish loading completely (triggering the "load" event). Experiment with alternative wait strategies (e.g. wait_until="domcontentloaded" or self.page.wait_for_selector(...))
